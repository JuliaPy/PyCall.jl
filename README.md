# Calling Python functions from the Julia language
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jakebolewski/PyCall.jl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jakebolewski/PyCall.jl)

This package provides a `@pyimport` macro that mimics a Python
`import` statement: it imports a Python module and provides Julia
wrappers for all of the functions and constants therein, including
automatic conversion of types between Julia and Python.

It also provides facilities for lower-level manipulation of Python
objects, including a `PyObject` type for opaque Python objects and a
`pycall` function (similar in spirit to Julia's `ccall` function) to
call Python functions from the Julia language with type conversions.

## Installation

Within Julia, just use the package manager to run `Pkg.add("PyCall")` to
install the files.  Julia 0.2 or later is required.

The latest development version of PyCall is avalable from
<https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl>.  If you want to switch to
this after installing the package, `cd ~/.julia/PyCall` and `git pull
git://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl master`.

## Usage

Here is a simple example to call Python's `math.sin` function and
compare it to the built-in Julia `sin`:

    using PyCall
    @pyimport math
    math.sin(math.pi / 4) - sin(pi / 4)  # returns 0.0

Type conversions are automatically performed for numeric, boolean,
string, and function types, along with tuples, arrays/lists, and
dictionaries of these types.  Python functions can be converted to
Julia functions but not vice-versa.  Other types are supported via the
generic PyObject type, below.

Python submodules must be imported by a separate `@pyimport` call, and
in this case you must supply an identifier to to use in Julia.  For example

    @pyimport numpy.random as nr
    nr.rand(3,4)

Multidimensional arrays exploit the NumPy array interface for
conversions between Python and Julia.  By default, they are passed
from Julia to Python without making a copy, but from Python to Julia a
copy is made; no-copy conversion of Python to Julia arrays can be achieved
with the `PyArray` type below.

Keyword arguments can also be passed. For example, matplotlib's
[pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/) uses keyword arguments to specify plot
options, and this functionality is accessed from Julia by:

    @pyimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    x = linspace(0,2*pi,1000); y = sin(3*x + 4*cos(2*x));
    plt.plot(x, y, color="red", linewidth=2.0, linestyle="--")
    plt.show()

However, for better integration with Julia graphics backends and to
avoid the need for the `show` function, we recommend using matplotlib
via the Julia [PyPlot module](https://github.com/stevengj/PyPlot.jl).

Arbitrary Julia functions can be passed to Python routines taking
function arguments.  For example, to find the root of cos(x) - x,
we could call the Newton solver in scipy.optimize via:

    @pyimport scipy.optimize as so
    so.newton(x -> cos(x) - x, 1)

The biggest diffence from Python is that object attributes/members are
accessed with `o[:attribute]` rather than `o.attribute`, and you use
`get(o, key)` rather than `o[key]`.  (This is because Julia does not
permit overloading the `.` operator yet.)  See also the section on
`PyObject` below, as well as the `pywrap` function to create anonymous
modules that simulate `.` access (this is what `@pyimport` does).  For
example, using [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Seq) we can do:

    @pyimport Bio.Seq as s
    @pyimport Bio.Alphabet as a
    my_dna = s.Seq("AGTACACTGGT", a.generic_dna)
    my_dna[:find]("ACT")

whereas in Python the last step would have been `my_dna.find("ACT")`.

## Python object interfaces

The `@pyimport` macro is built on top of several routines for
manipulating Python objects in Julia, via a type `PyObject` described
below.  These can be used to have greater control over the types and
data passed between Julia and Python, as well as to access additional
Python functionality (especially in conjunction with the low-level interfaces
described later).

### Types

#### PyObject

The PyCall module also provides a new type `PyObject` (a wrapper around
`PyObject*` in Python's C API) representing a reference to a Python object.

Constructors `PyObject(o)` are provided for a number of Julia types,
and PyCall also supplies `convert(T, o::PyObject)` to convert
PyObjects back into Julia types `T`.  Currently, the types supported
are numbers (integer, real, and complex), booleans, strings, and
functions, along with tuples and arrays/lists thereof, but more are
planned.  (Julia symbols are converted to Python strings.)

Given `o::PyObject`, `o[:attribute]` is equivalent to `o.attribute`
in Python, with automatic type conversion.  To get an attribute as a
`PyObject` without type conversion, do `o["attribute"]` instead.

Given `o::PyObject`, `get(o, key)` is equivalent to `o[key]` in
Python, with automatic type conversion.  To get as a `PyObject`
without type conversion, do `get(o, PyObject, key)`, or more generally
`get(o, SomeType, key)`.  You can also supply a default value to use
if the key is not found by `get(o, key, default)` or `get(o, SomeType,
key, default)`.  Similarly, `set!(o, key, val)` is equivalent to
`o[key] = val` in Python, and `delete!(o, key)` is equivalent to `del
o[key]` in Python.

#### PyArray

Multidimensional NumPy arrays (`ndarray`) are supported and can be
converted to the native Julia `Array` type, which makes a copy of the data.

Alternatively, the PyCall module also provides a new type `PyArray` (a
subclass of `AbstractArray`) which implements a no-copy wrapper around
a NumPy array (currently of numeric types or objects only).  Just use
`PyArray` as the return type of a `pycall` returning an `ndarray`, or
call `PyArray(o::PyObject)` on an `ndarray` object `o`.  (Technically,
a `PyArray` works for any Python object that uses the NumPy array
interface to provide a data pointer and shape information.)  

Conversely, when passing arrays *to* Python, Julia `Array` types are
converted to `PyObject` types *without* making a copy via NumPy,
e.g. when passed as `pycall` arguments.

#### PyVector

The PyCall module provides a new type `PyVector` (a subclass of
`AbstractVector`) which implements a no-copy wrapper around an
arbitrary Python list or sequence object.  (Unlike `PyArray`, the
`PyVector` type is not limited to `NumPy` arrays, although using
`PyArray` for the latter is generally more efficient.)  Just use
`PyArray` as the return type of a `pycall` returning a list or
sequence object (including tuples), or call `PyVector(o::PyObject)` on
a sequence object `o`.

A `v::PyVector` supports the usual `v[index]` referencing and assignment,
along with `delete!` and `pop!` operations.  `copy(v)` converts `v` to
an ordinary Julia `Vector`.

#### PyDict

Similar to `PyVector`, PyCall also provides a type `PyDict` (a subclass
of `Association`) that implements a no-copy wrapper around a Python
dictionary (or any object implementing the mapping protocol).  Just
use `PyDict` as the return type of a `pycall` returning a dictionary,
or call `PyDict(o::PyObject)` on a dictionary object `o`.  By
default, a `PyDict` is an `Any => Any` dictionary (or actually `PyAny
=> PyAny`) that performs runtime type inference, but if your Python
dictionary has known, fixed types you can insteady use `PyDict{K,V}` given
the key and value types `K` and `V` respectively.

Currently, passing Julia dictionaries to Python makes a copy of the Julia
dictionary.

#### PyTextIO

Julia `IO` streams are converted into Python objects implementing the
[RawIOBase](http://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase)
interface, so they can be used for binary I/O in Python.  However,
some Python code (notably unpickling) expects a stream implementing
the
[TextIOBase](http://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase)
interface, which differs from RawIOBase mainly in that `read` an
`readall` functions return strings rather than byte arrays.  If you
need to pass an `IO` stream as a text-IO object, just call
`PyTextIO(io::IO)` to convert it.

(There doesn't seem to be any good way to determine automatically
whether Python wants a stream argument to return strings or binary
data.  Also, unlike Python, Julia does not open files separately in
"text" or "binary" modes, so we cannot determine the conversion simply
from how the file was opened.)

#### PyAny

The `PyAny` type is used in conversions to tell PyCall to detect the
Python type at runtime and convert to the corresponding native Julia
type.  That is, `pycall(func, PyAny, ...)` and `convert(PyAny,
o::PyObject)` both automatically convert their result to a native
Julia type (if possible).   This is convenient, but will lead
to slightly worse performance (due to the overhead of runtime type-checking
and the fact that the Julia JIT compiler can no longer infer the type).

### Calling Python

In most cases, the `@pyimport` macro automatically makes the
appropriate type conversions to Julia types based on runtime
inspection of the Python objects.  However greater control over these
type conversions (e.g. to use a no-copy `PyArray` for a Python
multidimensional array rather than copying to an `Array`) can be
achieved by using the lower-level functions below.  Using `pycall` in
cases where the Python return type is known can also improve
performance, both by eliminating the overhead of runtime type inference
and also by providing more type information to the Julia compiler.

* `pycall(function::PyObject, returntype::Type, args...)`.   Call the given 
  Python `function` (typically looked up from a module) with the given
  `args...` (of standard Julia types which are converted automatically to
  the corresponding Python types if possible), converting the return value
  to `returntype` (use a `returntype` of `PyObject` to return the unconverted
  Python object reference, or of `PyAny` to request an automated conversion).

* `pyimport(s)`: Import the Python module `s` (a string or symbol) and
  return a pointer to it (a `PyObject`).  Functions or other symbols
  in the module may then be looked up by `s[name]` where `name` is a
  string (for the raw `PyObject`) or symbol (for automatic
  type-conversion).  Unlike the `@pyimport` macro, this does not
  define a Julia module and members cannot be accessed with `s.name`.

* `pyeval(s::String, rtype=PyAny; locals...)` evaluates `s`
  as a Python string and returns the result converted to `rtype`
  (which defaults to `PyAny`).  The remaining arguments are keywords
  that define local variables to be used in the expression.  For 
  example, `pyeval("x + y", x=1, y=2)` returns `3`.

* `pybuiltin(s)`: Look up `s` (a string or symbol) among the global Python
  builtins.  If `s` is a string it returns a `PyObject`, while if `s` is a
  symbol it returns the builtin converted to `PyAny`.

* `pywrap(o::PyObject)` returns a wrapper `w` that is an anonymous
  module which provides (read) access to converted versions of `o`'s
  members as `w.member`.  (For example, `@pyimport module as name` is
  equivalent to `name = pywrap(pyimport("module"))`.)  If the Python
  module contains identifiers that are reserved words in Julia
  (e.g. `function`), they cannot be accessed as `w.member`; one must
  instead use `w.pymember(:member)` (for the `PyAny` conversion) or
  `w.pymember("member")` (for the raw `PyObject`).

### Initialization

By default, whenever you call any of the high-level PyCall routines
above, the Python interpreter (corresponding to the `python`
executable name) is initialized and remains in memory until Julia
exits.

However, you may want to modify this behavior to change the default
Python version, to call low-level Python functions directly via
`ccall`, or to free the memory consumed by Python.  This can be
accomplished using:

* PyCall uses the Python executable specified by the `PYTHON`
  environment variable, or `"python"` if the environment variable
  is not set, in order to determine what Python libraries to use.
  You can set this environment variable as usual in your operating
  system (e.g. in the Unix shell before running Julia), or from
  within Julia via `ENV["PYTHON"] = "..."`.  Alternatively, you
  can call `pyinitialize` (below) explicitly.

* `pyinitialize(s::String)`: Initialize the Python interpreter using
  the Python libraries corresponding to the `python` shared-library or
  executable name given by the argument `s`.  Calling `pyinitialize()`
  defaults to `pyinitialize(get(ENV,"PYTHON","python"))` as described
  above, but you may need to change this in rare cases.  The
  `pyinitialize` function *must* be called before you can call any
  low-level Python functions (via `ccall`), but it is called
  automatically as needed when you use the higher-level functions
  above.  It is safe to call this function more than once; subsequent
  calls will do nothing.

* `pyfinalize()`: End the Python interpreter and free all associated
  memory.  After this function is called, you *may no longer restart
  Python* by calling `pyinitialize` again (an exception will be
  thrown).  The reason is that some Python modules (e.g. numpy) crash
  if their initialization routine is called more than once.
  Subsequent calls to `pyfinalize` do nothing.  You must *not* try
  to access any Python functions or data (that has not been *copied*
  to native Julia types) after `pyfinalize` runs!

* The Python version number is stored in the global variable
  `pyversion::VersionNumber`.

### GUI Event Loops

For Python packages that have a graphical user interface (GUI),
notably plotting packages like matplotlib (or MayaVi or Chaco), it is
convenient to start the GUI event loop (which processes things like
mouse clicks) as an asynchronous task within Julia, so that the GUI is
responsive without blocking Julia's input prompt.  PyCall includes
functions to implement these event loops for some of the most common
cross-platform [GUI
toolkits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit):
[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/), [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/),
and [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) (via the [PyQt4](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4) or [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)
Python modules).

You can set a GUI event loop via:

* `pygui_start(gui::Symbol=pygui())`.  Here, `gui` is either `:wx`,
  `:gtk`, or `:qt` to start the respective toolkit's event loop.  It
  defaults to the return value of `pygui()`, which returns a current
  default GUI (see below).  Passing a `gui` argument also changes the
  default GUI, equivalent to calling `pygui(gui)` below.  You may
  start event loops for more than one GUI toolkit (to run simultaneously).
  Calling `pygui_start` more than once for a given toolkit does nothing
  (except to change the current `pygui` default).

* `pygui()`: return the current default GUI toolkit (`Symbol`).  If
  the default GUI has not been set already, this is the first of
  `:wx`, `:gtk`, or `:qt` for which the corresponding Python package
  is installed.  `pygui(gui::Symbol)` changes the default GUI to
  `gui`.

* `pygui_stop(gui::Symbol=pygui())`: Stop any running event loop for `gui`
  (which defaults to the current return value of `pygui`).  Returns
  `true` if an event loop was running, and `false` otherwise.

To use these GUI facilities with some Python libraries, it is enough
to simply start the appropriate toolkit's event-loop before importing
the library.  However, in other cases it is necessary to explicitly
tell the library which GUI toolkit to use and that an interactive mode
is desired.  To make this even easier, it is convenient to have
wrapper modules around popular Python libraries, such as the [PyPlot
module](https://github.com/stevengj/PyPlot.jl) for Julia.

### Low-level Python API access

If you want to call low-level functions in the Python C API, you can
do so using `ccall`.  Just remember to call `pyinitialize()` first, and:

* Use `pysym(func::Symbol)` to get a function pointer to pass to `ccall`
  given a symbol `func` in the Python API.  e.g. you can call `int Py_IsInitialized()` by `ccall(pysym(:Py_IsInitialized), Int32, ())`.

* PyCall defines the typealias `PyPtr` for `PythonObject*` argument types,
  and `PythonObject` (see above) arguments are correctly converted to this
  type.  `PythonObject(p::PyPtr)` creates a Julia wrapper around a
  `PyPtr` return value.

* Use `PythonObject` and the `convert` routines mentioned above to convert
  Julia types to/from `PythonObject*` references.

* If a new reference is returned by a Python function, immediately
  convert the `PyPtr` return values to `PythonObject` objects in order to
  have their Python reference counts decremented when the object is
  garbage collected in Julia.  i.e. `PythonObject(ccall(func, PyPtr, ...))`.
  **Important**: for Python routines that return a borrowed reference,
  you should instead do `pyincref(PyObject(...))` to obtain a new
  reference.

* You can call `pyincref(o::PyObject)` and `pydecref(o::PyObject)` to
  manually increment/decrement the reference count.  This is sometimes
  needed when low-level functions steal a reference or return a borrowed one.

* The function `pyerr_check(msg::String)` can be used to check if a
  Python exception was thrown, and throw a Julia exception (which includes
  both `msg` and the Python exception object) if so.  The Python 
  exception status may be cleared by calling `pyerr_clear()`.

* The function `pytype_query(o::PyObject)` returns a native Julia
  type that `o` can be converted into, if possible, or `PyObject` if not.

* `pyisinstance(o::PyObject, t::Symbol)` can be used to query whether
  `o` is of a given Python type (where `t` is the identifier of a global
  `PyTypeObject` in the Python C API), e.g. `pyisinstance(o, :PyDict_Type)`
  checks whether `o` is a Python dictionary.  Alternatively,
  `pyisinstance(o::PyObject, t::PyObject)` performs the same check
  given a Python type object `t`.  `pytypeof(o::PyObject)` returns the
  Python type of `o`, equivalent to `type(o)` in Python.
